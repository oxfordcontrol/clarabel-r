Description: A versatile interior point solver that solves linear programs (LPs), quadratic programs (QPs), second-order cone programs (SOCPs), semidefinite programs (SDPs), and problems with exponential and power cone constraints (<https://clarabel.org/stable/>). For quadratic objectives, unlike interior point solvers based on the standard homogeneous self-dual embedding (HSDE) model, Clarabel handles quadratic objective without requiring any epigraphical reformulation of its objective function. It can therefore be significantly faster than other HSDE-based solvers for problems with quadratic objective functions. Infeasible problems are detected using using a homogeneous embedding technique.
